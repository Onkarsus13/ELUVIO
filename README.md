# ELUVIO Datascience ML challange

In This Notebook i have done predactivate modeling of the data. I have used Bidirectional-RNN model for predection the "up_works" from the data you gave me.
Run the given Notebook in google colab with same dataset, exact output you will be seen there.
Unzip the rar datafile and uplood it to drive which you want to make the storage for colab.
There is also 'final.h5' pretrained model by me  for the direct inferance.
